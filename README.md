***

The following algorithms are implemented till date:
1. Gaussian Mixture Models
2. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
3. K-Means Clustering
4. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Keras
5. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in PyTorch
6. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
